dotfiles :)

I manage all my dotfiles with: nothing. I spent 1 hour researching dotfile
managers only to settle on creating a script to do it for me in 10 mins ðŸ¤·

Pretty minimal rice:

I have a conky script that displays my org agenda for the day. I also receive a notification 15,5,0 minutes before
something on my agenda is scheduled to happen.

I have an org timer polybar module that helps me keep track of how long it takes for me to complete certain tasks. 
When I'm clocked in for a task and have the polybar menus toggled on it will display.
