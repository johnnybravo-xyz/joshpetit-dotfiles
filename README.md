deleteLastImage - deletes the last image added to Pictures. 
Because that folder is a rat's nest honestly.

rmwindows and togglewindow - I didn't use i3 at the time
and I always wanted to toggle a certain window so this
just does that. I use i3 now though so don't really need these any more.

toggleBluetoothDevices - Connects/disconnects from certain devices
toggleDnd - this was for gnome so I don't use it anymore.

Why am I explaining my dotfiles. It's not like anyone is going to use this lol.
